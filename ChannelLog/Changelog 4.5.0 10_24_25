🧩 Core Architecture & Structure

Rebuilt the suite’s front end with a refreshed “Navigation” home page, tile cards, and a redesigned sidebar (TileButton UI).

Removed External Mode logic completely — all external-mode checks and toggles were deleted.

Game detection and “Game Running” LED were removed, eliminating lag and background process scanning.

Added a minimal TileButton class to replace undefined references and unify sidebar tab design

🖥️ UI & Interaction Changes

Introduced pill-style “StatusBadge” labels replacing LED indicators (green/red → textual “running” / “stopped”).

Redesigned Quick Status panel:

Removed the “Open Launcher” button.

Switched to direct toggle-based state management (no background scanning).

Lowered rebinder interval from 1000 ms → 3000 ms to reduce CPU load.

Sidebar navigation reordered:

Launcher and UWP Launcher now appear next to each other.

Drift Lab moved to the bottom.

Began integrating Switch + StatusBadge inside each navigation tile (InputRX, CrossXir, Streamer) — groundwork added for next iteration.

⚙️ Behavior and Logic

All feature toggles (InputRX, CrossXir, Streamer) now drive their functions directly; no more “running” state detection.

InputRX and CrossXir are enabled by default on app start.

Removed dependency on psutil for runtime status checks (was causing UI delay).

QuickStatus refresh now relies purely on toggle signals instead of polling

suite_one_app_safe_baseline_PRO

.

Updated _toggle_* methods to simplify toggle actions and messaging consistency.

Deleted unused _game_running() and _kick_scan() functions.

🧠 Code Cleanups & Fixes

Patched undefined variable errors:

Added missing TileButton definition.

Removed all references to launch_btn (caused AttributeError before).

Removed redundant QuickStatus rebinder calls and replaced with simplified update cycles.

Merged multiple redundant _resolve_suite() variants into one clean, consistent method.

Cleaned legacy indentation errors, improved layout spacing, and replaced manual color-based status with semantic badges.

🪄 Visual / Theming

Tiles and sidebar now use soft gradients, rounded corners, and hover animations.

Simplified status color logic — now based on consistent theme palette instead of arbitrary QColors.

Improved alignment/padding in NavCard and status controls for cleaner layout.
