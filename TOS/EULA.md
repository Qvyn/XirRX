This End User License Agreement (“**EULA**”) is a legal agreement between you (“**You**” or “**End User**”) and **[Your Company/Name]** (“**Licensor**”) for the XirRX software, including any associated media, documentation, updates, and support materials (collectively, the “**Software**”).

By installing or using the Software, You agree to be bound by this EULA. If You do not agree, do not install or use the Software.

## 1. License Grant
Licensor grants You a limited, revocable, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to install and use one copy of the Software on a Windows device You own or control, solely for Your personal or internal business purposes, in accordance with this EULA.

## 2. Restrictions
You may not, and may not permit anyone else to:
- Copy, modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of the Software, except to the extent permitted by applicable law.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law.
- Rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise transfer the Software or any rights thereto, except with Licensor’s prior written consent.
- Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices or labels on the Software.
- Use the Software for any unlawful purpose or in a manner that infringes third‑party rights.

## 3. Ownership
The Software is licensed, not sold. Licensor and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights, except for the rights expressly granted to You under this EULA.

## 4. Updates; Changes
Licensor may provide updates or changes to the Software at its discretion. Updates may modify or remove features. This EULA applies to any updates that Licensor provides, unless a separate license is provided with an update.

## 5. Third‑Party Components
The Software may include or rely on third‑party components that are provided under separate licenses (for example, **PyQt6 (LGPLv3)**, **psutil (BSD)**, and **PyInstaller (GPL with exception)**). To the extent required by those licenses, You may have additional rights. Copies of the relevant third‑party licenses are provided in the “Third‑Party Notices” section below and/or in accompanying files. If a third‑party license grants You rights that are broader than this EULA, those rights will control solely for that component.

> **Note:** If You redistribute the Software, You are responsible for complying with the terms of any third‑party licenses, which may include providing license texts, notices, and/or object code or source access as applicable. Seek legal advice if unsure.

## 6. Privacy; Telemetry
The Software does not collect or transmit personal data by default. If You contact Licensor for support, You may share diagnostic information voluntarily. See the Terms of Service and any applicable Privacy Notice for details.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR‑FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.

## 8. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS EULA, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS IN THE AGGREGATE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

## 9. Acceptable Use; Streaming
XirRX includes a **Streamer Mode** that attempts to exclude the CrossXir overlay from screenshots/recordings via Windows APIs. Effectiveness may vary depending on Your system and capture method. You are responsible for testing Your setup and for complying with applicable game, platform, and anti‑cheat rules.

## 10. Termination
This EULA is effective until terminated. It will terminate automatically if You breach any term. Upon termination, You must cease using the Software and destroy all copies. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., Ownership, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability) will survive termination.

## 11. Export; Sanctions
You represent that You are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country or on any list subject to U.S. or other applicable sanctions. You agree to comply with all export and re‑export restrictions and regulations.

## 12. Governing Law; Venue
This EULA is governed by the laws of **[Your State/Country]**, excluding conflict‑of‑laws rules. Courts located in **[Your City/State/Country]** will have exclusive jurisdiction.
