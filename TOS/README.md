What is XirRX?

XirRX is a small Windows app that brings two tools together in one place:

Crosshair Overlay (CrossXir) — a clean, adjustable crosshair on top of your game.

Input Tuning (InputRX) — tweak how your inputs feel.

It also has:

a Launcher to start your favorite games/apps, and

a one-click Streamer Mode that hides the crosshair from screenshots and screen recording while you still see it.

Requirements

Windows 10 (version 2004 or newer) or Windows 11

No install needed. Just download and run XirRX.exe.

Some antivirus programs warn about new apps from unknown publishers. If you trust the source, choose “Run anyway.” Any warnings from AV is a FALSE POSITIVE

Quick Start (2 minutes)

Download XirRX.exe.

Double-click it to open.

You’ll see four tabs:

InputRX – Start/Stop input tuning.

CrossXir – Show/Hide the crosshair overlay.

Launcher – Add game/app shortcuts.

Streamer – Turn Streamer Mode on or off.

You can also right-click the tray icon (near your clock) for quick controls: Start/Stop InputRX, Show/Hide Overlay, Streamer Mode, and Launcher shortcuts.

Streamer Mode (what it does)

ON: Your crosshair is hidden from screenshots and screen recording (viewers won’t see it), but you still see it on your screen.

OFF: Everything works normally.

Tips

Works with Windows’ built-in screenshot/record tools and most modern recorders.

In OBS, use Display Capture or don’t capture the overlay window directly.

Using the Launcher

Open the Launcher tab → click Add.

Pick your game or app .exe. (Optional: add launch arguments or a working folder.)

Click Launch to start it.
You’ll see a “running/stopped” status at a glance.

Common Questions

Q: I can see the crosshair, but my viewers can’t.
A: That’s normal if Streamer Mode is ON. Turn it OFF if you want the crosshair visible on stream.

Q: The overlay disappeared from my stream but I still see it.
A: Streamer Mode is likely ON. That’s exactly what it’s for.

Q: Nothing happens when I press Start/Stop on InputRX.
A: Close XirRX and open it again. If it persists, try running as Administrator once.

Q: My antivirus flagged the app.
A: New apps from unknown publishers can trigger warnings. If you trust the source, allow it.

Privacy & Safety

XirRX doesn’t upload data anywhere.

Streamer Mode only changes how Windows captures the overlay window.

No background services are left running when you close the app.

Need help?

Make sure you’re on Windows 10 (2004+) or Windows 11.

Try restarting XirRX.

If a recorder still shows the crosshair with Streamer Mode ON, refresh or re-add your capture source and avoid capturing the overlay window directly.

Enjoy a cleaner stream and a simpler setup — all in one app.
